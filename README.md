## -Splunk-Log-Analysis-Lab-Practice_data
Ingestion, field extraction, search queries, visualizations, and alerting
In this project, I completed a hands-on Splunk lab focused on building core log analysis skills used in real-world security operations. The goal was to gain practical experience ingesting, exploring, and analyzing structured log data while applying common SOC workflows.

Throughout the lab, I worked with practice log files to perform data ingestion, field extraction, SPL searching, dashboard creation, and alert configuration. This project helped me understand how security teams use Splunk to detect suspicious activity, monitor systems, and generate actionable insights from log data.
